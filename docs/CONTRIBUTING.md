## Contributing

DelphiLint is open for contributions, from bug reports to new features. GitHub issues and pull requests are the core
locations for community involvement - check them out!

### Reporting bugs

> [!NOTE]
> Because DelphiLint's analysis is powered by SonarDelphi, problems relating to analysis quality should
> be raised on [SonarDelphi's issue tracker](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/sonar-delphi/issues).
>
> For example, the following issues should **not** be raised on the DelphiLint repository:
>
> * Errors parsing Delphi code
> * Unexpected analysis results (e.g. false positive issues)
> * Typos or inaccuracies in rule descriptions

Bugs with DelphiLint can be reported on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/delphilint/issues).
When reporting a bug, please do the following:
* Check that your issue has not already been reported
* Include the versions of SonarDelphi and the Delphi IDE (and SonarQube, if applicable) you are using
* Be as specific as possible in your description
* Ensure that your issue is not a SonarDelphi bug (if in doubt, raise a DelphiLint issue)
* If applicable, supply a minimal case that replicates the issue

### Requesting features

> [!NOTE]
> Because DelphiLint's analysis is powered by SonarDelphi, features relating to analysis quality should
> be raised on [SonarDelphi's issue tracker](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/sonar-delphi/issues).
>
> For example, proposals for new rules or improvements to existing rules should **not** be raised on the
> DelphiLint repository.

Feature requests can be listed on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/delphilint/issues).
Note that this does not necessarily mean a developer will decide to implement the feature - if you would like a feature
consider implementing it yourself and [making a pull request](#making-pull-requests).

When requesting a feature, please do the following:
* Check that a similar feature has not already been requested
* Be as specific as possible in your description
* Ensure that your suggested feature is not a SonarDelphi feature (if in doubt, raise a DelphiLint issue)

### Making pull requests

[Pull requests](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/delphilint/pulls) are welcome!
When making a pull request, please do the following:
* Ensure that the functionality is widely useful rather than specific to your use case
* For new features, ensure that it has been discussed in an issue prior to making the pull request
* Describe the contents of your pull request
* Clearly explain the rationale for adding it to DelphiLint
